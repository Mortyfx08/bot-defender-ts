This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing & CI/CD

### Frontend Test Suite
- **All frontend tests use React Testing Library and Polaris context.**
- **No backend or API server is required to run frontend tests.**
- **Tests cover loading, error, and success states for all major components.**
- **Fast, reliable, and isolatedâ€”perfect for CI/CD and Shopify app store review.**

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
npm test
```

### Continuous Integration
- Frontend tests run automatically on every push/PR via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- No backend or external services are required for frontend tests in CI.
